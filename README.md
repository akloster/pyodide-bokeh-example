# Minimal Bokeh/Pyodide Example

This is a minimal example to show how to get Bokeh running with Pyodide.


You need to download the pyodide distribution or symlink it to '/pyodide'.

Until Bokeh and its dependencies are merged into Pyodide, you'll need my pyodide fork[https://github.com/akloster/pyodide/tree/bokeh] and compile them yourself.
